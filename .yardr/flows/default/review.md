summary: The finished bead is reviewed against its goal; what the reviewer can fix is fixed, not sent back.

The finished bead is reviewed here, on its branch `yard/<bead>`, against the
bead: its goal, its "done when" and the builder's notes. The review is
forward: what the reviewer can fix with confidence is fixed on the branch
(commits starting `review:`), not sent back.

Approval here is the last review before the bead is merged, so be thorough.

Before the bead leaves, you have run the depot's gate on the branch as it now
is (`sh .yardr/check`), and your note carries your own gate line: the command,
the commit, the result. The builder's gate line is not a substitute. One note
on the bead says how the review ended. Outcomes:

- `done`, approved: the note says what you checked, what you fixed (commits),
  the gate result, and any remaining risk. The bead is landed from
  `approved`.
- `changes`, it needs the builder: the design is wrong, the bead was misread,
  or a large part is missing. The note gives concrete, actionable findings,
  and the bead goes back to `new`. If the notes show the bead has already
  come back from review twice, do not send it back a third time: note why and
  `yardr bead hold <id>` so the mayor looks at it.
- `question`, it needs a decision only Benchi can make: the note has
  the question and the options, and the bead goes to `decide`.

A branch that came from another yard (`yardr bead show` says `branch
yard/<bead> came from <peer>`) carries no gate line this yard trusts: run
the depot's gate (`sh .yardr/check`) on it yourself, whatever the returned
notes say, and read those notes as an account of the work, written where it was
done.

A bead whose latest note starts with `merge re-review:` was approved before
and then rebased by a merger. Only the conflict resolution is reviewed. Sound:
the note has the range-diff summary and the gate result, and the outcome is
`done`. Not sound, and not fixed forward: `changes` with a concrete finding,
or `question`.
